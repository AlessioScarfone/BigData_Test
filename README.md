# BigData_Test

http://www.mat.unical.it/ricca/downloads/bigdata.zip

1)Transform the original table in another one that
is suitable for creating a cactus plot.

Algorithm name is in column "Solver"
Execution time is in column "Real"

2)Create a cactus plot table for each domain

3)Compute statistics for each solver:
  - number of solved instances
  - cumulative execution time
  - average execution time on solved instances
  - variance execution time on solved instances
  - stdev execution time on solved instances
  - five numbers for execution times on solved instances

Submit: Create a repository and share it with ciccioricca on github


### EX.1

N		| Solver1 |	Solver2 |
----|---------|---------| 
1		|1.457		|	2.88		|
2		|2.58			| 3,7			|	
..	| ...			| ...			|



**NOTE:** you can run the ant script called "build.xml" for run the project

**NOTE EX1:** the output of "exercise 1" is in the folder result/BigDataTest_Ex1_o/1
